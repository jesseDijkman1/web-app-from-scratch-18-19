## Description
This week we continued working on our apps. I continued with my second app: weedApp. This app uses more data which makes it easier to make a better detail page (because there is more data). 

---

## API
Otreeba Open Cannabis API - [API Documentation](https://api.otreeba.com/swagger/)

My chucknorris app didn't handle a lot of data, atleast not enough to render a decent detail page. That's why I searched for a new API and I was looking for one that didn't need an API-key. And I found one about cannabis. 

### Pros and cons

**Pros:**
- No authentication needed
- There's a lot of data
- Returns JSON

**Cons:**
- Not a great documentation in my opining
- __**There's an unknown rate limit**__

### The rate limit
The Open Cannabis API has a rate limit of ... I don't know. I can't find it anywhere and it seems to be a bit random. The rate limit actually ruins my app and I don't know if there's a work around (because it isn't documented).
