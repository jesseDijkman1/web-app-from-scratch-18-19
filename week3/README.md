## Description 🧐
This week was the final week of the course: WAFS (Web app from scratch). During this week I worked on the rickAndMorty app. The rick and morty app is the final iteration of the apps I made for this course. Although I'm not satisfied with it yet, (because I only had a few days) I'm pretty happy with the speed and the way it works. 

### API 🔌
The rickAndMorty app uses the [rickAndMorty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/). This API is free to use, has a rate limit of 10000 and **doesn't need authentication**. The API works really fast in my opinion ⚡️. It was a good API to create something with in just a few days. 

### Assignment 📙
Make a client side web app based on data from an API. The app needs to render an overview and detail page. It also needs to include filter and sorting options ❌ (not enough time left). Write as much vanilla javascript, no frameworks (react, vue, etc).

## Process 📈
### [Week 1](https://github.com/jesseDijkman1/web-app-from-scratch-18-19/tree/master/week1#week-1)
"Monday we all started with the minor: web-development and started with this course. The assignment for week 1 was to render an index.html without frameworks or libraries. Fairly easy, so I was finished with this part on Monday."

### [Week 2](https://github.com/jesseDijkman1/web-app-from-scratch-18-19/tree/master/week2#description-)
"This week we continued working on our apps. I continued with my second app: weedApp. This app uses more data which makes it easier to make a better detail page (because there is more data)."

### Week 3
During this week (last week) I had to finish two courses ([CSS-to-the-rescue](https://github.com/jesseDijkman1/CSS-to-the-rescue), and [wafs](https://github.com/jesseDijkman1/web-app-from-scratch-18-19). This week I started again from almost scratch. There were a few pieces of code I was able to reuse; like the createElement from templater.

## Diagrams 📊
For this course I had to make two diagrams that helped explain my application. The actor diagram and the interaction diagram. 

### Actor Diagram 🤷‍♂️
"An Actor diagram is focused on (code)objects that can be seen as the actors of your code. WHO handles functionality in your app." [Source](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17zwy1Kj4vqM5jqYWz7U6Spi_7i9ucucyBeAMDAfn0mY/edit)

### Interaction Diagram 🕹
"The Interaction diagram focuses on WHAT happens in your code. It visualizes functions and shows how action flows through your application."[Source](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17zwy1Kj4vqM5jqYWz7U6Spi_7i9ucucyBeAMDAfn0mY/edit)
